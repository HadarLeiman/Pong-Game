# Pong-Game
Java OOP project 

In this project I created a pong game using the java awt platform.

Installation:
1. Download the attached files
2. Open the command line
3. run "ant compile"
4. run "ant run"
5. If you want to determine the order of the levels in the game run "ant -Dargs="1 3 2 1 9 1 bla 3 4 3" run" (where "1 3 2 1 9 1 bla 3 4 3" are the levels you want between 1-4)

Enjoy :)
